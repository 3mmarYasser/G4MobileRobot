# G4MobileRobot

G4MobileRobot is a mobile robot project implemented using an Arduino, L298N DC Motor Driver, and HC-05 Bluetooth module. The robot is controlled remotely using the RemoteXY mobile app.

## Features

- **Arduino-based:** The project utilizes the Arduino platform for easy programming and flexibility.
- **L298N DC Motor Driver:** The robot is powered by the L298N dual H-bridge motor driver, enabling precise control of the DC motors.
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module:** Remote control of the robot is achieved using the HC-05 Bluetooth module, allowing wireless communication with the RemoteXY app.
- **RemoteXY Integration:** The robot's control interface is created using the RemoteXY app, providing an intuitive and user-friendly remote control experience.
